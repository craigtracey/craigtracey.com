    Craig is currently the Automation Technical Lead at <a href="http://www.hubspot.com/">HubSpot</a>. Day-to-day he drives a small team of engineers delivering infrasctructure automation solutions that manage many thousands instances across various cloud providers; including <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>, <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/">Rackspace</a>, and <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>.

    Before HubSpot, Craig helped build scaleable backup solutions at <a href="http://www.carbonite.com/">Carbonite</a>, delivered vmkernel network stack changes at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a>, and helped address system-level defects in early releases of the <a href="http://www.netezza.com/">Netezza</a> data warehouse appliance.

    As he believes that OpenStack is poised to democratize cloud computing, he has focused most of his recent open source efforts towards contributing to various projects within that ecosystem. Some of this work may be found on <a href="http://www.github.com/craigtracey">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~craigtracey">Launchpad</a> and <a href="https://review.openstack.org/#/dashboard/6530">OpenStack Code Review</a>
